# TerminalChat application

Allows users on the same network to chat through a console.

Current features include:

messaging single users, groups of users, or all users, saves messages for recipients who are not online,

creating polls for specific groups or all users,

and other small helper commands (listing current users, listing group members, aliasing text with shortcuts, etc.)

* there are some small issues with spacing/formatting because GitHub is being difficult *
